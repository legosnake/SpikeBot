# Spike


Spike is a open source Discord bot coded in JavaScript with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) by [LegoSnake](https://github.com/LegoSnake).  
Feel free to add a star ⭐ to the repository to promote the project!

## Installation

### Customized version

Unfortunately, at this time, there is no way to Self-host Spike. I am planning to eventually allow this but as of now, it's not allowed. Sorry!
